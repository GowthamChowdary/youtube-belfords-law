Checking if belford's law applies to Youtube views, likes, dislikes and comments. 
I came across the show "connected" on netflix today and was blown away by the "digits" episode where the host Latif Nasser explores belford's law and it's applications in seemingly irrelavent places. 


# What is belford's law?
In a random set of numbers, the first digits of the numbers follow an intresting , predictable pattern. This is belford's law in layman's terms.


# Conclusion

Youtube follows the belford's law. The views, likes, comments, even dislikes all follow Belford's law! 
I'm amazed.
